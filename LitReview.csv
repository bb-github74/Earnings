Teupker et al. ,"JGIM, 2013",V.A. PCPs and CBOCs in urban and rural Oregon and S. Washington,observational qualitative study,Interview and focus groups with employees ,15 VA primary care clinics ,Limited resources for implementation; changes required in broader VA system (greater control to clinic); PACT advocated from clinic and leadership necessary for change. ,"limited to one region, affects generalizability; interviewed at different points of intervention; focus was on employee not patient perceptions  ",,,Recommendations System: predict items user might like
Nutting et al. ,"AFM, 2010",PCPs,Evaluation of practices in NDP,"Direct observation, in depth interviews, email streams, medical records, patient practice surveys",35 practices in 25 states ,6 emerging themes; created model of practice change and development; small practices need resource expansion; illustrative case summaries ,Data collected by NDP facilitator subject to bias,Focuses on National Demonstration Project (NDP),,
O'Malley et. al.,"JGIM, 2014",PCPs in 17 states ,Qualitative study ,2-3 phone interviews lasting 45-60 minutes ,"27 primary care practices, 63 respondents ","incremental delegation of nonclinical tasks away from physicians; expanding role of medical assistants and nurses; inclusion of staff input imp for staff buy in; team huddles guided role delegation, consistency of info; nurse care managers imp team members; desire for training of key members. ","Cant generalize to all PCPs, NCQA framework not widely validated ",,,
Reid et al.,"Health Affairs, 2010","Clinics in Seattle, Washington",two-group quasi experimental before and after evaluation,Surveys ,"19 group health clinics, 6187 adult staff, 4747 study patients ","favorable outcomes can be received by investing in primary care, adaptive leadership and patient voices, pair leadership with strong change management, patient centered electronic records",variable response rate to surveys; residual selection biases ,,,

Luck et al. ,"JGIM, 2014",V.A. facilities across states,Multi-method evaluation ,"Website usage analytics, online survey of PACT community of practice’s use of the toolkit, key informant interviews ",544 PACT members at 136 VA facilities,range of user perspectives; participants reported somewhat easy to implement the new tools; social marketing and training is key to successful dissemination ,Non response bias; respondents don’t reflect denying to be interviewed; perception of toolkit may change after it becomes routine; effect on provider behavior not assessed. ,,,
Bleser et al. ,"AFM, 2014",small-midsized practices in PA,Qualitative study ,semi structured interviews and focus groups ,"136 individual interviews, 7 focus groups with 48 individuals, 20 medical practices",13 strategies to obtain practice buy-in; 3 lessons; extends Solberg's conceptual framework,restricted to PCPs in single region; generalizability is in question because participating practices received additional funding,,,
Rittenhouse et al. ,"Health Affairs, 2008",Medical groups across USA,Qualitative study ,NSP02 35 minute phone survey,"291 medical groups (medical director, president or CEO); Independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians ",Explored whether increased PCMH infrastructure is associated with organizational size; 1/3 medical groups use primary care teams at majority of practices; 65% medical groups participate in quality improvement collaborative and 36% use PDSA cycle; 30% medical groups use group visits for patients with chronic illness (enhanced access); physician directed medical practice is more common with smallest and largest medical groups (U shaped curve); PCMH adoption among large medical groups is low but strong PCMH structure seen in very large organizations.  ,studied only infrastructure components of PCMH model; NSP02 data doesn’t only include measures of personal physician or payment reform; measures for each infrastructure component was not exhaustive; leaders may overstate extent of PCMH structure in their organization. ,,,
Solberg et al. ,"JABFM, 2014",Medical homes in Minnesota,Qualitative study,105 item survey about presence and function of practice systems; clinic performance measures; 44 item survey about PCMH transformation; qualitative interviews ,120 clinics serving adults to be certified ,"Identifies 44 organizational factors using transformation survey; clinics that made the greatest changes in their systems paid a lot of attention to change process, culture and patient-centeredness; finance and quality were deemed most important. ",practices not typical of the whole country or Minnesota; performance on quality measures vary with certified practices; high performing practices were longstanding leaders; bias in reporting systems. ,,,
Reed et al. ,"Biomed Central (BMC) Family Practice, 2012","Five health plans, five provider organizations, ten primary care clinics in Washington State",qualitative study,Semi structured key informant interviews 45-60 minutes ,"5 health plans/insurance providers (state sponsored, public purchaser, a private for profit, 2 private non profit plans); 5 provider organizations (multispecialty, physician group, IPA, non profit multihospital multispecialty group; 10 clinics (two from each provider organization) ","Health plans, provider organizations and clinics shared goals of quality improvement. Shared goals of cost containment but not emerging from providers; providers focused on expanding market power; patient oriented goals by provider organizations rather than health plans; practices were engaged in staff and provider satisfaction efforts ",Restricted to Pugest Sound Region (small sample); limitations with generalizability to care settings in other contexts,,,
True et al. ,"JGIM, 2013",Primary care clinics in one Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) across 6 states ,"Qualitative, formative evaluation ","Site visits during first 6 months of implementation, observation at learning collaboratives, semi structured interviews, review of internal organizational documents ",10 medical centers and 45 outpatient clinics ,"Key themes found - leadership engagement, staffing resources, access to information and knowledge; readiness for implementation is key to transformation to PCMH; Actions of local administrations disbursing funds that were not in line with PACT initiative created barriers to access;  Ability of pilot teams to leverage health information technologies was important to improve access    ",Not feasible to track pilot team's activity; face to face interaction limited with early adopters; follow up interview conducted with champion of implementation - limited consistency with changes implemented; may have overstated positives ,,,
Wise et al. ,"Milbank Quarterly, 2011",PCPs from physician organizations in Michigan,Comparative case study ,66 semi structured interviews from 8 practice teams with higher PCMH scores and 8 teams with lower PCMH scores and leaders of physician org,16 practices from 12 different physicians organizations ,"Respondents from higher and lower PCMH scoring practices commented on similar aspects of readiness-motivation and capability but offered different views; understanding practice perception is important in motivating PCMH change; strong hospital association did not differentiate practices on any relevant theme; organizational support was important no matter who provided it (physician, hospital etc); Identified motivations include perceived value of PCMH, understanding of PCMH requirements, financial incentives, commitment to change. ",Limited time to volunteer practices; limited to Michigan; didn’t look at true stand alone independent practices - results can be generalized to unaffiliated private practices ,,,
Fernald et al. ,"Family Medicine, 2011",family medicine residency training programs (Colorado Family Medicine Residency PCMH),Comparative case study ,"Qualitative analysis of field notes, interviews and documents ",9 family medicine residency programs in Colorado ,"Identified 9 common barriers: negative experiences with quality improvement or routines incompatible with transformation, leadership gaps, skepticism and cynicism aimed at change or ability to change, unproductive team processes, lack of accountability, knowledge gaps about PCMH, other programs distracted focus from implementation, sponsoring organization's constraints - staffing rules and differing priorities, insufficient staff participation, communication problems due to part time faculty and residents; Barriers can be addressed by attention and reflection from on site coaches by realigning talents, leaders and priorities. ","reports on small set of structured observations within residential family practices, genralizability limited without comparing non residency practices, study can be used as a guide not prescription.
